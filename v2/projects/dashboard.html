          <h2>A CLI for basic things.</h2>
          <p>
            Dashboard was an command-line interface written in Python that I
            created alongside two other teammates as part of my school's
            computing coursework. We worked on it over two years over two
            stages; the end product is a neat and useable product for all.

          <h2>Here's the history.</h2>
          <p>
            Dashboard was the end product of two years' worth of effort for my
            school's computing coursework. Certainly, while it has been an
            imperfect journey, it gave me much more opportunities ‚Äî both the
            good and bad ‚Äî that allows me to become a better, more efficient,
            and more collaborative contributor in the context of teamwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            We started in 2020 with project ideation. The project to create the
            Dashboard was not our first idea. For the coursework in 2020, we
            were tasked to come up with a programmatic solution that can be
            written with the Python 3 language to solve an issue that a
            particular vulnerable group in society faces. Certainly, coming up
            with ideas was indeed difficult; we settled on the idea to have a
            program manage someone's financials through a command-line interface
            ‚Äî a budgeting program of sorts.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the second coursework initiated in late 2020, we were tasked
            with transforming our ideas into real, workable code. For my team,
            we decided to look at what we had and start from the ground up.
            While that meant sacrificing the time we had, I think it had been
            worth it to come up with a new, more creative solution. We began
            development on our code a month later than others, given our
            reconsideration and new solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project concluded in early 2021, following a group presentation
            and a live demonstration of the program.

            They also play an important role in the creation of the product, and
            it would've been much difficult if it weren't for their assistance!

          <h2>Ready for all.</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout the coursework, it was best for us to keep our code
            closed-source and proprietary to prevent plagiarism of any kind from
            other groups with malicious intent. We also believed that it was
            fair for us to do so, to prevent accidents occurring on our end and
            from other groups and to prevent any misunderstandings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that the project has concluded, though, the team has agreed to
            make the program's code open-source. While development for the
            project has halted with the conclusion of the project, any critical
            updates, bug fixes, or sharing of tips can be discussed in the
            project's Issues page.
