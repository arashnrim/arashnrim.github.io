            It all began in a little interest in understanding how my family's
            computer worked. The Internet was a scary place for small me then; I
            spent most of my time away from it and instead spent time exploring
            the computer. I spent a lot of time seeing how the computer worked,
            which built the foundation for where I am today.

            Joining kindergarten, I had so much to learn and share. I was the
            (not so small) kid who would always get excited at the introduction
            of new things to try.
          </p>

          <h3 id="primaryschool">Primary school</h3>
          <p>
            Every trip to the computer lab seemed like paradise to me, and it
            didn't take long before I managed to get weekly access to the lab by
            joining the school's ICT Club.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to my experience in the early days, I blazed through content
            and managed to pick up things efficiently.

          <p>
            If you were to ask me if secondary school was the most impactful
            time of my life, I'd strongly agree. Since joining secondary school,
            a whole lot of new experiences exposed me to have hands-on
            experience with code.

            Most of my skills come from here ‚Äî I've participated in programmes,
            joined hackathons, and met so many friends who share the same and
            more elaborate dreams as I do.

          <h3 id="care">üíû Care</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Serious attention or consideration applied to doing something
            correctly or to avoid damage or risk.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Even though the dictionary definition specifies 'damage' and 'risk',
            I don't only care for tasks or handling work. Caring for people is
            equally, if not more, important than that. My personal definition of
            care includes:
          </p>
          <h4>Care for others</h4>
          <p>
            A definite top priority, caring for others is the most important of
            the 'care' factor ‚Äî simply, you can't establish a good relationship
            without caring. To me, caring means more than just keeping close
            contact; it's also understanding another person, and seeing what I
            can contribute to have a meaningful relationship.
          </p>
          <h4>Care for work and responsibilities</h4>
          <p>
            Prioritising care for work and responsibilities is also essential,
            besides the people aspect. By caring for my work and
            responsibilities, I handle all my tasks effectively, efficiently,
            and successfully; during challenging times, I'll make it an effort
            to try to find ways to resolve the problem.
          </p>
          <h4>Care for self</h4>
          <p>
            It starts with yourself: you can't establish caring for others if
            you don't start to care for yourself. That's why I also take up the
            challenge to continue caring for myself, by inspiring and motivating
            through rough moments to keep myself optimistic.
          </p>

          <h3 id="respect">ü§ù Respect</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Due regard for the feelings, wishes, or rights of.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            In all my school experience, respect has been the value that's been
            the hardest to show. It often lacks in many nowadays, and many also
            tend to misinterpret respect. My personal definition of respect
            covers:
          </p>
          <h4>Respect for others</h4>
          <p>
            Respect is a chain that establishes and sustains relationships. By
            showing respect, you acknowledge someone else's identity, voice, and
            opinion by allowing them to share, convey, and elaborate.
          </p>
          <h4>Respect for opinions</h4>
          <p>
            Not everyone will have the same opinion as me, since everyone has
            their own points of view. I won't disregard anyone just for having
            conflicting views. No exceptions.
          </p>

          <h3 id="responsibility">üóÇ Responsibility</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The state or fact of being accountable or to blame for something.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Responsibility is a task that many seem to struggle with ‚Äî even I do
            at times. However, I can't and won't let stressful moments break me
            from being responsible for tasks; be it homework or projects, I try
            my best to persevere and fulfil the responsibility provided to me.
          </p>

          <h3 id="perseverance">üí™ Perseverance</h3>
          <blockquote>
            Persistence in doing something despite difficulty or delay in
            achieving success.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I don't put down quickly when stress comes in. I tend to find
            positives among negative situations to make myself gear up and
            prepare for the worse better.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also utilise methods of reflection to make sure that I
            internalise, process, and understand why things happen the way they
            do ‚Äî and what I can do moving forward from a negative experience.
          </p>

          <h3 id="integrity">üß† Integrity</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The quality of being honest and having strong moral principles or
            the state of being whole and undivided.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            I find the definition of integrity interesting; that's why I've
            decided to take in both definitions and compartmentalise them
            through different segments:
          </p>
          <h4>Integrity of mental health</h4>
          <p>
            We are in an age where it has never been so easy to break down from
            stress, pressure, and hardships. I've learnt the importance of
            establishing mental integrity, to make sure that I don't break when
            reaching rock bottom.
          </p>
          <h4>Integrity of emotions</h4>
          <p>
            Sharing feelings can be challenging, especially when it's crossing
            into the boundary of a sensitive topic. Despite so, I'll try to make
            it essential that my emotions are never compromised.
          </p>
          <h4>Integrity of opinion</h4>
          <p>
            Having an opinion is something that I still need to work on; most of
            the times, I'll take up and remain in a neutral stance, but I'll try
            to express my opinions where due.
          </p>
          <h4>Transparency.</h4>
          <p>
            Transparency can be difficult in some cases. Even so, I'll try to be
            as truthful as I can, being transparent in everything that I do.
            It's still something I need to work towards ‚Äî ideal transparency ‚Äî
            but I'm getting there!

            <li>I've had fun exploring computers before education.</li>
            <li>
              During my early days in school, I used to spend a lot of breaks on
              computers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Starting primary school, I solidify to take my passion through
              joining the ICT Club.
            </li>
            <li>
              Secondary school gave me everything I need to get started, and I'm
              very grateful for it.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Core values</h2>
          <p>
            These core values help me operate everyday, even if the impact is

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Care</b> keeps me in check; I try to care for others, care for

            <li>
              <b>Respect</b> makes sure that I continue to establish good
              relationships; I try to show respect for others and respect for
              opinions.

            <li>
              <b>Responsibility</b> holds me accountable for all my work; I try
              to keep them on track.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Perseverance</b> makes me push against the tides when the table

            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Integrity</b> provides me with ways to cope and upholds my
