          <p>
            List√© was an app I created alongside two other teammates as part of
            the Swift Accelerator Programme. Despite its simplistic UI, a lot
            went behind the scenes; I learnt a lot from this project.

          <h2>Here's the history.</h2>
          <p>
            List√© was created as a project between me and two other teammates
            for the
            <a href="https://swiftinsg.org">Swift Innovators' Summit</a>, the
            end-year summit held to conclude the yearly Swift Accelerator
            Programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ideation began in mid to late 2019. While we were aware of the
            different to-do lists that existed out there, we realised that many
            of them were overly complicated with things we often didn't need.
            Our idea was to create a to-do list app that focused on simplicity;
            all you had to fill up is a task's name, an optional description,
            and a due date.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the next month or two, I helmed the main responsibility as the
            primary app developer for our team. Working individually while
            receiving feedback and updates from my teammates allowed a smooth
            development process for the app. The app was final and ready to be
            published by October of the year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020, I began the process of re-writing the app from the ground
            up. List√© version 2.0 has since been completed and is now live on
            the Play Store. While our team hasn't worked together on this
            re-write as we have before, I did my best to keep the original
            intention and design of the app intact.

            They also play an important role in the creation of the product, and
            it would've been much difficult if it weren't for their assistance!

                simple-to-understand documentation alongside tutorial videos
                accelerated my learning of how to use it. Initially starting out
                with Realtime Database, my team made the decision to use Cloud
                Firestore instead. We also used Authentication for, well,
                authentication.

            In 2020, I made the executive decision to make the app's source code
            open-source. My intention was to allow those who were new to
            programming to explore what it was like to create a to-do list app;
            my app was one of the thousands out there, notwithstanding the many
            tutorial videos that may also already exist.
