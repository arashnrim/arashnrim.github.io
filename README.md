# website

Welcome to the repository of my website (accessible at https://arash.codes)! The current version is the third iteration, and features code that is written by me from the ground up; this is in contrast to previous iterations where I had relied on a pre-made template.

This repository hosts all iterations of my website, from the first to latest. Refer to the [tags](https://github.com/arashnrim/website/tags) or visit the view the source code for the respective iteration.

| [v1.0](https://github.com/arashnrim/website/releases/tag/v1.0) | The first iteration of my website. Based on the Story template from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/), I mostly edited the contents and the styling to suit my own preferences.                                                 |

## Motivations

Having a website of my own meant that I had a little space on the internet that I could call my own. I would be able to share more with prospective connections about myself all while learning by doing. Instead of relying on learning platforms to be walked through overly-simplified projects, I wanted to engage myself with a practical product — in this case, being able to share more about myself.

I made the switch to build the website from scratch (without a boilerplate template as I had before) since I wanted to explore something new.
