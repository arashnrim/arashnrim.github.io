# website

Welcome to the repository of my website (accessible at https://arash.codes)! This version is the third iteration, and features code that is written by me from the ground up; this is in contrast to previous iterations where I had relied on a pre-made template.

The source code features the following tech stack:

|  Technology  | Description of use |
|:------------:|:-------------------|
| [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)      | The framework used to power the entire website. Part of the Jamstack architecture, it allows me to easily build the website. |
| [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) | The CSS framework used to style the website. It allows me to easily style the website while keeping the design standardised. |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com)       | The platform used to deploy the website. It allows me to effortlessly publish live changes to the domain at a single push. |

## Motivations

Having a website of my own meant that I had a little space on the internet that I could call my own. I would be able to share more with prospective connections about myself all while learning by doing. Instead of relying on learning platforms to be walked through overly-simplified projects, I wanted to engage myself with a practical product — in this case, being able to share more about myself.

I made the switch to build the website from scratch (without a boilerplate template as I had before) since I wanted to explore something new.
