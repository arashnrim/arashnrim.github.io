          <p>
            Upgrade was an iOS app created for a school project, with the aim of
            helping students understand their academic achievements better.

          <h2>Here's the history.</h2>
          <p>
            Upgrade was a group project I created for a school project, Project
            Decimus. The goal of the project was to create an iOS app that
            served as a conclusion to the school curriculum covering design,
            innovation, and creation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project took place in 2019 over the course of almost
            three-quarters of the year. With the help of consultations and
            regular checkups, we were ensured that our group project was as good
            a quality as possible with advice from the teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We went through many processes of thinking, and the final app idea
            definitely was not our first. Nonetheless, with close collaboration,
            we managed to settle on an idea and work closely to design, develop,
            and plan the app. The project concluded with a group presentation
            and showcase.

            They also play an important role in the creation of the product, and
            it would've been much difficult if it weren't for their assistance!

                simple-to-understand documentation alongside tutorial videos
                accelerated my learning of how to use it. Initially starting out
                with Realtime Database, my team made the decision to use Cloud
                Firestore instead. We also used Authentication for, well,
                authentication.
